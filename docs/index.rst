Overview
==========

The National Biogeographic Map is a project from the U.S. Geological Survey Core Science Systems Mission Area. Our goal is to provide a platform for analysis of questions about what species are where, how well protected they are, how vulnerable they are to stressors, and what management options will have the greatest benefit for conservation of biodiversity. The documentation here covers a range of topics from technical matters on data and software code to case studies on scientific analyses supported by the platform.
