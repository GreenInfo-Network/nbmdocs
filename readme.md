National Biogeographic Map Documentation

This repo contains a standalone Sphinx docs package for documenting the National Biogeographic Map as a whole. To contribute, clone the repo, create a branch, build docs, commit, and issue a pull request with review requested from someone else in the team. Anyone on the team can merge a pull request, but please do get a second set of eyes on your contributions and be judicious in what you write. The documentation here is currently being auto-built to a couple of locations.
